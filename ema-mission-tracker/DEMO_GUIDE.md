- **Show:** Evidence-based recommendations

**Why this matters:** *"In deep space, communication delays can be 7-15 minutes each way. ARIA can make preliminary assessments and recommendations without waiting for Earth."*

---

### Demo 2: Landing Site Intelligence (60 seconds)

**Navigate to Landing Sites Screen**

**Select Beta Site (Oceanus Procellarum)**

**Say:** *"ARIA provides comprehensive landing site analysis combining geological expertise with mission engineering."*

**Show the AI analysis displayed:**
- Risks: Surface hazards, operational challenges
- Benefits: Scientific value, resource potential
- Recommendation: Clear go/no-go decision

**Why this matters:** *"Landing on an asteroid is incredibly challenging - low gravity, unknown terrain. ARIA helps us make informed decisions that could save the mission."*

---

### Demo 3: Real-time Anomaly Detection (60 seconds)

**Return to Dashboard**

**Say:** *"ARIA continuously monitors telemetry for anomalies and provides instant analysis."*

**Wait for or trigger an anomaly** (they occur every ~30 seconds)

**When anomaly appears:**
- **Point out:** Instant detection and alert
- **Show:** AI provides technical root cause analysis
- **Highlight:** Priority-based alerting (High/Medium/Low)

**Alternative:** Ask ARIA: *"What would happen if system temperature dropped to -10°C?"*

**Why this matters:** *"Early anomaly detection can prevent catastrophic failures. ARIA acts as a 24/7 mission analyst."*

---

### Demo 4: Scientific Expertise (45 seconds)

**Navigate to Science Analysis Screen**

**Select any sample (e.g., Iron-Nickel spectrum)**

**Show AI analysis:**
- Composition interpretation
- Scientific significance
- Comparison to expected values
- Mining implications

**Say:** *"ARIA has deep knowledge of M-type asteroids and can interpret scientific data like an expert astrogeologist."*

**Why this matters:** *"Asteroids like Lutetia contain trillions of dollars in platinum-group metals. ARIA helps us identify the most valuable targets."*

---

### Demo 5: Advanced Interaction (45 seconds)

**Return to AI Chat**

**Ask a complex question:**
*"Compare the economic value of mining Beta Site versus Gamma Site, considering extraction difficulty"*

**Highlight in response:**
- Economic analysis capability
- Trade-off reasoning
- Practical recommendations
- Business viability assessment

**Say:** *"ARIA doesn't just analyze science - it understands the commercial viability of asteroid mining missions."*

---

### Closing & Export (30 seconds)

**Click Export button**

**Say:** *"ARIA can export complete analysis sessions for mission reports and documentation."*

**Show the export preview**

**Final statement:**
*"This is the future of space exploration - AI that doesn't replace human decision-making, but augments it with real-time analysis, predictive capabilities, and deep domain expertise. ARIA makes every mission safer, more efficient, and more scientifically productive."*

## 🚨 Common Questions & Answers

**Q: "Is this using real AI or just pre-scripted responses?"**
A: "Real AI - Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash. Every response is generated in real-time based on current telemetry and conversation context. The prompts are engineered, but responses are authentic AI reasoning."

**Q: "How does this handle communication delays in space?"**
A: "ARIA runs on the spacecraft, so it can provide instant analysis without Earth contact. The 7-15 minute delay to Earth means AI-assisted decision-making is crucial for time-sensitive operations."

**Q: "What if the AI makes a wrong recommendation?"**
A: "ARIA is a decision support tool, not autonomous control. It provides analysis and recommendations, but humans make final decisions. Think of it as an expert advisor, not autopilot."

**Q: "Can this work with real mission data?"**
A: "Absolutely. The telemetry structure mirrors real spacecraft data formats. The AI prompts are designed around actual space mission constraints and can ingest real sensor data."

**Q: "What's the commercial potential?"**
A: "M-type asteroids like Lutetia contain platinum-group metals worth trillions. ARIA can identify the highest-value extraction sites and assess economic feasibility - critical for commercial mining ventures."
